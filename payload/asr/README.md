# Windows ASR runtime

pinvou3 resolves the optional offline voice recognition runtime from:

```text
{install_dir}/runtime/asr/pinvou-asr.exe
```

This directory contains the Windows offline ASR runtime used by the MSI build:

```text
runtime/asr/
  pinvou-asr.exe
  llama-funasr-sensevoice.exe
  models/
    fsmn-vad.gguf
```

The main installer intentionally does not include the large
`sensevoice-small-q8.gguf` recognition model. The app downloads that model on
first voice use to:

```text
~/.pinvou3/asr/sensevoice-small-q8.gguf
```

The small `fsmn-vad.gguf` VAD model remains bundled with the runtime because it
is tiny and improves voice activity detection.

`llama-funasr-sensevoice.exe` is built from the FunASR llama.cpp runtime with
portable x64 CPU flags for the project test machine. The upstream prebuilt
binary can fail on older CPUs if it was compiled with unsupported native
instructions.

The executable must support the stable pinvou command shape:

```text
pinvou-asr.exe asr --model sensevoice-q8 --lang zh --input <wav>
```

It should print the recognized text to stdout.

This repository provides the `pinvou-asr` wrapper source at
`src/asr/pinvou_asr.rs`. It is kept outside `src/bin` so installer bundlers do
not treat it as an application sidecar target.

Alternative model locations accepted by `pinvou-asr.exe`:

```text
~/.pinvou3/asr/
  sensevoice-small-q8.gguf

runtime/asr/
  gguf/
    sensevoice-small-q8.gguf
    fsmn-vad.gguf

runtime/asr/
  runtime/
    llama-funasr-sensevoice.exe
    models/
      sensevoice-small-q8.gguf
      fsmn-vad.gguf
```

Useful development overrides:

```powershell
$env:PINVOU3_ASR_CMD="E:\path\to\pinvou-asr.exe"
$env:PINVOU3_ASR_BACKEND="E:\path\to\llama-funasr-sensevoice.exe"
$env:PINVOU3_SENSEVOICE_MODEL="E:\path\to\sensevoice-small-q8.gguf"
$env:PINVOU3_SENSEVOICE_VAD="E:\path\to\fsmn-vad.gguf"
pinvou-asr.exe asr --input sample.wav
```

Legacy PaddleSpeech-compatible backends are still accepted as a fallback by
setting `PINVOU3_ASR_BACKEND_KIND=paddlespeech`.
